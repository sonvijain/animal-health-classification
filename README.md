# Description

Our project focuses on conservation of wildlife and to protect, restore and enhance natural ecosystems. We aim to develop a predictive model that determines whether an animal's condition is dangerous and if it is at the risk of dying or not by drawing upon five distinct symptoms. We have used the animal condition classification dataset from kaggle which features a diverse array of species, ranging from birds to mammals, with each animal having five distinct symptoms. These symptoms include fever, coughing, weight loss, pain and diarrhea.

We have trained the model using Random Forest Classifier to classify whether an animal is in danger. Thorough data cleaning was done to get a refined data set. We also faced the problem of an unbalanced dataset so we used the Random Over Sampling method to balance the dataset.Exploratory data analysis reveals significant insights about the danger level of the animal. This can inform decision-making for animal welfare, thus aiding bio-heritage conservation.

Improved understanding and management of animals help in maintaining their population, contributing to biodiversity.
